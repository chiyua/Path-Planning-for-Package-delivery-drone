# Path-Planning-for-Package-delivery-drone
Executing DronePathPlanning.exe file will process data from input.txt file and will save processed data(calculated shortest time) in output.txt file.

1) Input (input.txt)
Test cases containing waypoint information are in file input.txt. The program will read the file and parse data from the file.

2) Output(output.txt)  
For each test case, the smallest possible time will be printed in output.txt file as decimal number (rounded to three decimal places) on its own line. There is no blank lines between each line.

3) Dijkstra's algorithm is used for calculating shortest possible time
In source code, there is another algorithm (Greedy method) written, but in comment.

4) This program is built in Visual studio 2019.
